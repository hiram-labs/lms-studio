# **Platform Onboarding Playbook**

This document provides a comprehensive guide for onboarding organizations, headsets, and trainees to the platform. The platform comprises three core services:

1. **LMS (Directus):** Used to manage training modules, organization information, and trainee (user) details.
2. **LRS (Learning Locker):** Captures and enriches trainee interactions with training modules.
3. **Studio:** A user interface for authenticating and initializing modules for trainees, as well as managing ad-hoc tasks, including onboarding activities.

When a new client or organization is acquired, onboarding involves three distinct processes:

1. Organization onboarding.
2. Headset onboarding.
3. Trainee onboarding.

The following sections outline detailed playbooks for each process.

---

## **Organization Onboarding**

This process captures an organization's information and assigns a dedicated LRS store to it. This ensures that training module engagement data from trainees is stored in the appropriate datastore.

---

### **Steps for Organization Onboarding**

#### **1. Create a Store and Client in LRS**

1. **Log in to the LRS Platform**

   - Navigate to the LRS site.
   - Enter your credentials.
     > **Note:** Administrator access is required to complete this step.

2. **Create a New Organization**

   - Under the `Site Administrator` section, click **View All Organizations**.
   - Select **Organizations** from the left navigation panel.
     > **Tip:** If the panel is hidden, click the hamburger icon to reveal it.
   - Click **Add New** to open the organization creation form.
   - Enter the organization details as requested and save.

3. **Create a Store for the Organization**

   - Click the **Switch Organization (⇆)** icon.

     > **Format Tip:** Use `Organization Name Store` as the title.

4. **Create or Update the Client**

   - Navigate to **Settings > Clients**.
   - Confirm that a client titled `New xAPI Store Client` is auto-created. If not, click **Add New** to create one.

   - Ensure the following configurations:
     - **Enabled:** Checkbox is selected.

     - `Key`
     - `Secret`
     - `Basic Auth`
       > **Important:** Ensure the `Basic Auth` value starts with `Basic` and preserve this prefix when copying.

#### **2. Add Store Client Credentials in Directus**

1. **Log in to the LMS (Directus)**

   - Navigate to the Directus site.
   - Enter your credentials.
     > **Note:** You need `MAINTAINER_USER_ROLE` access for this step.

   - Click the **Add New (+)** icon to open the form.
   - Enter the organization name (as used in the LRS setup) and save.

     - **organization_lrs_key:** Set to the `Key` value from the LRS setup.
     - **organization_lrs_secret:** Set to the `Secret` value from the LRS setup.
     - **organization_lrs_token:** Set to the `Basic Auth` value from the LRS setup.

## **Headset Onboarding**

_(Details forthcoming)_

---

## **Trainee Onboarding**

When an onboarded organization wants to enroll new trainees (referred to as "actors" in the context of Directus), these trainees need to be added to Directus. This enables them to access training modules and ensures their engagement is correctly tracked. Adding trainees requires four key pieces of information:

- **Trainee organization** (provided by organisation)
- **Trainee name** (provided by organisation)
- **Trainee email** (provided by organisation)
- **Trainee PIN** (generated by us and an automated email sent to the trainee with this information)

---

### **Steps for Trainee Onboarding**

#### **1. Log in to the LMS (Directus)**

1. Navigate to the Directus site.
2. Enter your credentials.
   > **Note:** You need `MAINTAINER_USER_ROLE` access for this step.

---

#### **2. Add the Trainee**

1. **Access the Actor Management Section**

   - In the left navigation menu, select **Content (■)**.
   - From the submenu, choose **LMS Actor Access**.

2. **Add a New Trainee**

   - Click the **Add New (+)** icon to open the form.

3. **Provide the Required Trainee Details**

   - **PIN:** Enter the trainee’s PIN.
     > **Important:** PINs must be unique across the platform. To ensure uniqueness, use a two-digit prefix to group by organization.
   - **Organization:** Select the trainee’s organization from the list.
     > **Note:** Always add trainees to an existing organization. Do not create a new organization as part of this process.
   - **User ID:** Add the trainee as a user in the LMS by clicking the **Create Item (+)** icon in the `User ID` field.

4. **Complete User Information**

   - Fill in the required fields for the user:
     - **First Name**
     - **Last Name**
     - **Email**
     - **Token**
   - Ensure the `Role` field is set to **STUDIO_USER_ROLE**.

5. **Save the Trainee Information**
   - Click the **Save (✓)** icon to commit the entry.
